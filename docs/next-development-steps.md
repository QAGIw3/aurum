# Aurum: Next 10 Development Steps

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of the Aurum energy trading platform codebase, this document outlines the next 10 development steps prioritized by impact, risk, and dependencies. The roadmap balances immediate technical debt reduction with strategic architectural improvements and new feature development.

## Current State Analysis

**Codebase Overview:**
- **API Layer**: 68 Airflow DAGs, v1/v2 API versioning partially implemented
- **Data Pipeline**: 166 K8s manifests, 9 database migrations, comprehensive dbt models
- **Parsers**: 4 vendor curve parsers (PW, EUGP, RP, SIMPLE) with 37k+ lines of parsing logic
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Trino, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: E2E, integration, and unit test infrastructure with pytest

**Key Findings:**
1. Router registry migration is 70% complete but needs finishing
2. Vendor parser framework exists but needs connection to Airflow workflows
3. Service layer decomposition partially implemented but monolithic patterns remain
4. Cache management and rate limiting need unification
5. Documentation and API contracts require updates

### Phase 2: Integration (Weeks 5-8)  
**Focus:** Connect existing components
- Steps 2, 4: Parser integration + dbt enhancement
- Risk: Medium, dependent on Phase 1 completion

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 9-12)
**Focus:** Reliability and developer experience
- Steps 5, 6, 7: Cache unification + deployments + observability  
- Risk: Low, mostly additive improvements

### Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 13-16)
**Focus:** Documentation and optimization
- Steps 8, 9, 10: Feature flags + documentation + performance
- Risk: Low, non-blocking for core functionality
