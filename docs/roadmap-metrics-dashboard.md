```bash
# Measurement Script
#!/bin/bash
# Check dependency conflicts
pip-compile --dry-run pyproject.toml 2>&1 | grep -c "conflict"
# Target: 0 conflicts

# Check development environment setup time
time make install
# Target: <2 minutes
```

```sql
-- Track v1 endpoint extraction
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_endpoints,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN extracted = true THEN 1 END) as extracted_endpoints,
  (COUNT(CASE WHEN extracted = true THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) as completion_percentage
FROM api_endpoints_tracking;
-- Target: 100% extraction
```

#### Service Layer Decomposition
```python
# Track service layer metrics
def measure_service_decomposition():
    metrics = {
        'monolithic_service_loc': count_lines('src/aurum/api/service.py'),
        'domain_services_count': count_files('src/aurum/api/services/*.py'),
