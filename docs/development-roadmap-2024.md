# Aurum Development Roadmap 2024-2025

**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Active Planning  

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the strategic development plan for Aurum, building upon the existing [refactor plan](./refactor-plan.md) and addressing critical technical debt while advancing platform capabilities. The plan balances immediate operational needs with long-term architectural improvements over an 18-month timeline.

## Current State Analysis

### Platform Maturity Assessment
- **API Layer**: 138 Python files, dual v1/v2 architecture in migration
- **Core Services**: Scenarios (17 files), Parsers (15 files), robust data ingestion
- **Architecture**: Microservices-ready with FastAPI, Kafka, Trino, Iceberg foundation
- **Technical Debt**: Legacy monolith patterns, dependency sprawl, incomplete v2 migration

### Key Strengths
âœ… **Strong Foundation**: Modern data stack (Kafka, Iceberg, Trino)  
âœ… **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive docs, Docker compose, k8s setup  
âœ… **Observability**: Vector/ClickHouse logging, Prometheus metrics, tracing  
âœ… **Data Governance**: lakeFS versioning, Great Expectations validation  
âœ… **Testing**: Automated testing with pytest, contract testing, k6 performance  

### Critical Gaps
ðŸ”¶ **API Architecture**: v1/v2 split incomplete, router registry needs finishing  
ðŸ”¶ **Service Layer**: Monolithic service.py needs domain decomposition  
ðŸ”¶ **Dependency Management**: Version conflicts, optional dependency handling  
ðŸ”¶ **Caching Strategy**: Multiple cache implementations, inconsistent patterns  
ðŸ”¶ **Development Velocity**: Complex setup, slow feedback loops for developers
