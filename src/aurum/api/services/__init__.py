"""Domain service faÃ§ade modules.

These modules provide a stable, typed surface for routers while the legacy
`aurum.api.service` is gradually decomposed. Import services from here instead
of the legacy module to ease future refactors.

Phase 1.3 Service Layer Decomposition:
- Each domain has dedicated service classes
- Services implement standard interfaces for consistency  
- DAO pattern separates data access from business logic
- >85% test coverage requirement for service layer
